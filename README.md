# ExtractorGPT
This app extracts text from PDFs, images, excels, word docs and text files and sends it to chat GPT via API and returns 
whatever you ask it do with the text. 

In order for this app to work, you'll need to create a secret API key on OpenAI.com. Once an account has been created you can navigate to 
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
Once the key has been created, you can paste it in line 11 in between the quotation marks. 

You also might need to copy and paste the path to tesseract.exe in line 14 in between the quotation marks.

The app is tested and works.
